1- JXS -> javascript extension that allows us to put html inside of javascript.
	
	a-some of rules need to follow:
		1- you cant use class attribute insted you should use className.
		2- you can't use for attribute instead you should use htmlFor.
		3- when use a tage without ending tage like input, you need to keep the slash at the end of it 
		<input type='text' /> and not <iput type='text' >
		do <br /> and not <br>.
		4- when return you need to return single parent element aka one div.
		5- all this jxs is instead of:
			return Recat.creatElement(
				'div',
				{className: 'App'},
				React.creatElement('h1', null, 'this is my app')
			);
